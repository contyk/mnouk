# mňouk

An extremely simple and minimalistic root window title updater for X.
Originally intended for [koťátko](https://github.com/contyk/kotatko).

## Features

mňouk currently only displays the current time and date.

## Plans

Ridiculously, despite being intentionally minimalistic, mňouk is still missing
some features.  Namely:

* `config.h` support for the timestamp string.
* Locale support.
* Bound to the two above, dynamic memory buffer size support.
* A manual page.
